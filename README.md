# Blog Example 3

<hr>

**WARNING**: This is a work in progress.  Once this is complete this warning will be removed.  Thank you for your patience.  Refer to the [`.todo`](./.todo) file for outstanding items.  

<hr>

This is an example project for educational purposes.

This will show students what an almost production ready blogging platform using a MEAN stack will look like.  
Almost production ready because there are a few minor things you shouldn't do that this project does due to it being a development environment.  Like generating self-signed certs, checking in `.env` files with credentials, etc.  

And by MERN stack I specifically mean:

- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) (as Docker containers)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) (as the [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) Framework)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) (this will also use Material Design as part of the frontend techstack)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) (v10)

Also other technologies will be used as well such as Docker and Elasticsearch.

Though the source for this example is publicly available, no feature requests will be accepted.  
This is not a final product or utility, but an example of how a final production-ready project might look like.  
This is only intended to be used as educational material for anyone curious to learn what the source code of a real-world project with real-world business objectives would look like.  

However, even though feature requests won't be accepted, issues will be.  
If you notice anything unclear, inaccurate, or even a misspelling please feel free to [report an issue](https://github.com/BennyHoward/blog-example-3/issues).  
My goal is to make this as clear and informative as possible.
